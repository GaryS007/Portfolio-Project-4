## Agile Methodology

This project was planned using Agile Methodology. GitHub Issues was used to create user stories which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/GaryS007/Portfolio-Project-4/issues). Each User Story helped me understand a User/Admin requirements when using the blog site I had in mind. This was my first time using this methodology and the Django framework, so I feel like I could have used the user stories to dictate the priority of each future iteration. All of which can be implemented in Project 5.

I really felt that using Agile Method helped me stay focused on what tasks need to be completed. I can simply move a task to To Do for the next day and plan out which tasks can be completed so I stay focused and on schedule with my project. It also really helps manage expectations and time. Finally, who doesn't love putting a task in the 'done' section when completed!

## User Experience (UX)

### Site Goals

Luca's Pizza Blog is designed to entice people into learning about various pizza recipes but also to engage with a pizza chef and pizza community. It displays Blog Posts on the homepage with vibrant images and short descriptions to entice new users. Each Blog Post contains a new and unique recipe, which enables the user to engage with that content by liking or commenting on the post. It also provides information about the Pizza Chef via the about page. I wanted to include additional functionality by enabling any user to Search or Filter for recipes that they might be more interested in. This feature will become increasingly more useful as more blog posts get added, preventing the need to scroll through pages of content.

The target audience are pizza lovers of all ages that want to gain additional experience from a trained pizza chef.

### Wireframes

I created Wireframes using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) to help visualize how the final site would look and to allow me to plan accordingly. This method really helps me know where each element needs to go, while it might not look the same as the final version, it allows me to tick a lot of boxes then I can make final changes during the building phase where necessary.
